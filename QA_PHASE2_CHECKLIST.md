# Phase 2 QA Checklist - Sprint System & Real-time Features

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Realtime Foundation + Basic Sprint Start/Stop
- [x] **Database Setup**: Enabled realtime for tables (session_members, sprints, sprint_participations, notifications)
- [x] **Sprint Timer**: Basic start/stop functionality working
- [x] **Presence Tracking**: Users appear online when in session
- [x] **Live RSVP Count**: Member count updates in real-time
- [x] **Toast Notifications**: User join/leave events show toasts
- [x] **Timer Synchronization**: All users see same countdown based on start_time + duration

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Pause/Resume + Timer Math
- [x] **Database Schema**: Added paused_at and total_paused_ms columns
- [x] **Pause Functionality**: Host can pause sprint timer
- [x] **Resume Functionality**: Host can resume sprint with correct time calculation
- [x] **Robust Timer Math**: Accounts for accumulated pause time
- [x] **UI Indicators**: Shows "PAUSED" status in timer display
- [x] **Synchronized Pause State**: All users see pause/resume status

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Sprint Join/Leave (sprint_participations)
- [x] **Join Sprint Button**: Users can join active sprints
- [x] **Leave Sprint Button**: Users can leave sprints they've joined  
- [x] **Live Participant Count**: Shows current participant count with real-time updates
- [x] **Participant Avatars**: Displays participating users with names
- [x] **Status Guards**: Join/leave only available when sprint is active
- [x] **Real-time Participant Updates**: Participant list updates live for all users

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Reactions + Notifications
- [x] **Emoji Reactions**: 8 reaction emojis (üëç, üî•, üí™, ‚ú®, üöÄ, ‚ö°, üéØ, üíØ)
- [x] **Reaction Broadcasting**: Reactions broadcast to all sprint participants
- [x] **Reaction Animation**: Animated reactions appear on screen
- [x] **Reaction Counts**: Shows count badges on reaction buttons
- [x] **Notifications Database**: Uses notifications table for system notifications
- [x] **In-app Toasts**: Real-time toasts for reactions and events
- [x] **Notification Dropdown**: Bell icon with unread count and notification list
- [x] **Sprint Event Notifications**: Notifications for sprint start/end events

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Observability + Polish  
- [x] **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- [x] **Connection Status**: Visual connection status indicator
- [x] **Loading Skeletons**: Skeleton loading states for session page and components
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- [x] **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during async operations
- [x] **Performance**: Efficient real-time subscriptions with proper cleanup

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Sprint Timer Flow
- [ ] Host can start 25-minute sprint
- [ ] Timer counts down synchronously for all users
- [ ] Host can pause/resume sprint
- [ ] Timer accounts for pause time correctly
- [ ] Sprint auto-completes when timer reaches 0
- [ ] Host can manually end sprint early

### Participant Management
- [ ] Users can join active sprints
- [ ] Join button disappears after joining
- [ ] Users can leave sprints they've joined
- [ ] Participant count updates live for all users
- [ ] Participant avatars show correct users
- [ ] Join/leave buttons disabled when sprint not active

### Real-time Features
- [ ] User presence indicators work
- [ ] RSVP count updates without refresh
- [ ] New user joining shows notification to others
- [ ] Sprint start notifications sent to all members
- [ ] Sprint end notifications sent to all members

### Reactions & Engagement
- [ ] Emoji reactions broadcast to all participants
- [ ] Reactions animate on screen
- [ ] Reaction counts display correctly
- [ ] Only active sprint participants can send reactions
- [ ] Reactions show sender's name in toast

### Connection Resilience
- [ ] Connection status shows correctly
- [ ] Automatic reconnection on network loss
- [ ] Reconnection attempts display in UI
- [ ] Data syncs correctly after reconnection
- [ ] Error states handle gracefully

### Loading & Polish
- [ ] Session page shows skeleton while loading
- [ ] Sprint participants show skeleton during fetch
- [ ] Smooth transitions between states
- [ ] No loading flicker or layout shifts
- [ ] Error states provide clear user feedback

## Known Issues & Limitations
- Anonymous access policies (security warnings) - planned for Phase 3
- Leaked password protection disabled (security warning) - planned for Phase 3
- Sprint reactions only work during active sprint (intended behavior)
- Maximum 6 participant avatars shown (performance optimization)

## Performance Notes
- Real-time subscriptions cleaned up properly on component unmount
- Exponential backoff prevents excessive reconnection attempts  
- Participant queries limited to prevent large data fetches
- Skeleton loading prevents layout shift during data loading

## Phase 2 Complete ‚úÖ
All core sprint system and real-time features implemented with proper observability, error handling, and polish. Ready for Phase 3 enhanced features.
