# Ripl App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user visits Ripl, they land on a simple welcome screen offering three sign-up methods. They can choose to connect with LinkedIn, enter an email address with a password, or provide a phone number for SMS verification. If they select LinkedIn, they grant permission and are redirected back to the app. If they opt for email and password, they receive a verification link in their inbox before proceeding. For phone number sign-up, an SMS code confirms their identity. After verification, the user is guided into the app. From the main menu, they can sign out and later sign in again via the same three methods. If they forget their password, they tap the “Forgot Password?” link on the login screen, enter their registered email, receive a reset link, and set a new password before returning to the sign-in form.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once signed in, the user sees the Ripl dashboard split into two main areas. The left side invites them to start a private focus sprint, showing a button labeled “Solo Sprint,” while the right side lets them explore or create group sessions under “Coworking Sessions.” At the top, a notification bell alerts them to any pending friend requests or in-app messages. A search bar sits above a Google Map preview that highlights nearby public sessions. A simple header offers access to settings and account information. From this dashboard, the user taps the solo sprint or session entry to move into the corresponding flow. A persistent bottom navigation bar also appears on mobile, letting the user jump back to the home dashboard from anywhere in the app.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user taps the solo sprint entry, a modal slides up prompting them to type a private goal and choose either twenty or forty minutes for their timer. The goal field is a freeform text box. The user taps “Start Sprint” and the modal transforms into the sprint screen. Here they see a live countdown clock at the top, their goal displayed beneath, and buttons to pause or cancel the session. As time passes, the clock ticks down. When the timer reaches zero, confetti fills the screen and a summary shows their new streak count, any milestone badges earned, and an option to share anonymized stats. Tapping “Done” returns them to the dashboard.

If the user chooses to create a coworking session, they fill out a form titled “New Session.” They enter a session name, select duration, toggle between public or private link, and confirm their current location through an embedded Google Maps widget. They submit the form and a unique invite link appears. The app immediately adds the session to the user's Google Calendar. The user is taken to the session lobby.

Inside the session lobby, the host sees a row of teaser avatars representing attendees who have clicked the link. A lightweight pre-session chat sits below for casual messages. The host can remove any attendee before the session starts by tapping on their avatar and confirming removal. When the scheduled start time arrives or the host taps “Start Session,” the lobby transforms into the live session view. The map preview and chat slide away to make room for the full attendee list and sprint controls.

In the live session view, all participant names appear with either their LinkedIn profile picture or an anonymized handle. Each person sees a button labeled “Start Sprint” that opens the same goal-entry and timer selection modal used in solo mode. If a participant wants to join someone else’s active sprint, they tap the in-progress timer and join that timer instead of setting their own. The live session screen shows the group timer widget, a list of participants in that sprint with progress bars, and a row of emoji reaction buttons for quick feedback. When any sprint ends, confetti animation bursts across the screen. An ephemeral post-sprint chat window then opens, letting participants give feedback or share thank-you messages. This chat thread is only available until the session ends.

During a session, users can send a one-time direct message request to any other participant by tapping the person’s name and selecting “Send Message Request.” If the recipient accepts, the two become in-app friends with notifications muted by default. A friend list entry appears in the settings area. If they later delete a chat thread with that friend, the friendship is removed automatically.

To find other sessions, the user goes to the "Find a Jam" screen via the dashboard. The embedded Google Map highlights pinned café locations hosting public sessions. When a session has already started, the user may join if they are within fifty meters of the location. If they are farther away, they can use one of their five remote pass allowances for the month to join the session. If all remote passes are used, the join button is disabled and a message explains they must wait until their allowance renews.

## Settings and Account Management

In the settings page, the user sees personal account information, a section for notifications, and the friends list. They can update their email address, change their password, or edit their phone number. Under Notifications, they toggle alerts for when friends start solo or group sprints. The friend list shows all accepted connections, and tapping a friend allows them to unfriend by deleting the chat thread. Below, subscription options are reserved for future paid tiers but are shown as coming soon. A Billing subsection will eventually let users manage payments. From settings, a “Back to Dashboard” link always returns the user to the home screen.

Administrators access a separate internal-only dashboard by tapping a secret link in the footer. Here they see high-level metrics such as sessions created, invite links sent, attendee counts, and retention rates. Admins can filter by date range and drill into individual session details. They have tools to remove any user from a session, block disruptive accounts, or edit session parameters. All jam data and activity history remain stored indefinitely for analysis.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user enters invalid sign-in credentials, a red error message appears above the sign-in form explaining that the email or password is incorrect. During sprint setup, if the goal text is left blank or no timer is selected, a validation message appears beneath the corresponding field. If network connectivity is lost while in a session, a banner warns that the app is offline and attempts to reconnect automatically. If the user tries to join a session but has no remote passes left, a modal explains the restriction and offers instructions on how to gain additional allowances. When the session cap of fifty participants is reached, subsequent join attempts show a message indicating the session is full. For any critical failure, such as calendar sync error, a nonblocking toast appears noting that the integration failed but the user can continue without it.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From first launch to everyday use, Ripl guides the user through a clear path. They start by creating an account with minimal friction, then land on a dashboard offering solo focus or social coworking. Solo sprints let them set personal goals, track streaks, and earn private badges. Coworking sessions combine location-based invites, a shared pre-session lobby, and live group timers with reactions and ephemeral chats. Friend requests during sessions expand the social layer, and settings let users tune notifications and manage their network. Administrators maintain the health of the community with moderation tools and analytics. Throughout, context-sensitive messages handle errors or connectivity issues, ensuring the user always understands what to do next. This integrated experience balances private productivity and social accountability in one seamless web app.
