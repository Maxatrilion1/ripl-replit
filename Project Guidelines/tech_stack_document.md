# Ripl Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices behind Ripl in everyday language. Our goal is to show how each piece fits together to deliver a smooth, reliable, and secure productivity and social coworking experience.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

We built the user-facing side of Ripl with modern web tools that focus on responsiveness and ease of use.

- **React**
  - Core library for building user interfaces using components (think of them as Lego blocks).  
  - Allows us to update parts of the screen fast when data changes (like a timer counting down).  
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) & Service Workers**
  - Makes Ripl feel like a native app in your browser—offline support, installable icon, and push notifications.  
- **CSS Modules / Plain CSS**
  - Simple styling approach that keeps styles scoped to each component.  
  - Aligns with our brand colors (light blue buttons, orange accents, dark-blue text, etc.) without adding heavy frameworks.  
- **lovable.dev**
  - AI-powered scaffolding tool that jump-starts our front-end code.  
  - Accelerates boilerplate setup so we can focus on core features.

These choices let us build a clean, responsive interface quickly and adapt it later for design polish.

## 2. Backend Technologies

The backend powers data storage, session logic, and real-time collaboration.

- **Node.js & Express**
  - JavaScript runtime and web framework to handle user requests (login, sprint start, chat messages).  
  - Simple, fast, and backed by a huge ecosystem of packages.  
- **MongoDB**
  - NoSQL database for storing user profiles, session info, sprint stats, and badges.  
  - Flexible schema lets us evolve data models as the app grows.  
- **Redis**
  - In-memory store used for real-time features like ephemeral chats, live participant lists, and rate-limiting.  
  - Speeds up frequent operations (e.g., removing a chat automatically when a session ends).  
- **Socket.IO**
  - Real-time communication library that keeps everyone’s timers, reactions, and chat messages in sync.  
- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - **LinkedIn OAuth 2.0** for professional sign-in.  
  - **Email/Password** and **Phone/SMS Authentication** (via a service like Twilio) for wider access.  
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to securely track who is logged in and what they’re allowed to do (host vs. participant vs. admin).

Together, these tools handle data storage, user identity, and the live interactions that make Ripl feel social.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

We’ve chosen cloud and automation tools that make Ripl reliable, easy to update, and scalable.

- **AWS S3 & CloudFront**
  - Hosts front-end assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for fast global delivery.  
- **Docker**
  - Packs our backend services into containers so they run the same in development, testing, and production.  
- **GitHub & GitHub Actions**
  - Version control for all code.  
  - Automated CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy both front end and back end whenever we merge changes.  
- **Staging & Production Environments**
  - Separate deployments for testing and live use, reducing downtime and risk when releasing new features.

These choices ensure new code goes live smoothly, and we can quickly scale up if usage spikes.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

Ripl connects with a few external services to enrich the user experience.

- **Google Maps API**
  - Shows nearby cafés and session locations on an interactive map.  
- **Google Calendar API**
  - Automatically adds group session appointments to users’ calendars when they join.  
- **Google Analytics**
  - Tracks how users navigate the app, which helps us improve the flow over time.  
- **Twilio (or similar SMS service)**
  - Sends verification codes for phone number sign-up and login.  
- **LinkedIn OAuth**
  - Lets professionals join quickly without creating a new account.

These integrations remove friction (automatic invites to calendars), enrich location features, and help us learn how the app is used.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve put in place measures to keep user data safe and the app snappy.

- **Data Encryption**
  - All communication travels over HTTPS (TLS) to prevent eavesdropping.  
  - Sensitive information in the database is encrypted at rest when needed.  
- **Authentication Controls**
  - JWT tokens include expiration and can be revoked if a user logs out or reports abuse.  
  - Rate-limiting via Redis to prevent spammy requests (e.g., too many login attempts or messages).  
- **Role-Based Access**
  - Distinct permissions for jam hosts (edit sessions), admins (global moderation), and regular participants.  
- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Caching hot data in Redis to reduce database load.  
  - Code splitting and lazy loading on the front end so we only download what’s needed for each screen.  
  - Service workers cache static assets for instant reloads and offline support.

These steps protect user privacy, prevent abuse, and keep everyone’s timers and chats running smoothly.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Ripl’s technology choices are designed to deliver a fast, engaging, and secure web app that works in any modern browser. Here’s a quick recap:

- **Frontend:** React + PWA features for a native-like, responsive UI.  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redis, and Socket.IO for data, real-time features, and authentication.  
- **Infrastructure:** AWS S3, Docker, GitHub Actions for reliable hosting and continuous deployment.  
- **Integrations:** Google Maps, Calendar, Analytics, LinkedIn OAuth, and SMS verification for a richer user experience.  
- **Security & Performance:** HTTPS, JWT, rate-limiting, caching, and offline support.

Together, these technologies let Ripl focus on its core mission—helping users stay productive, whether they’re working alone or in a social coworking session—while keeping the code maintainable and the app ready to grow.
